    "# Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting Tutorial\n",
    "https://github.com/NirDiamant/Prompt_Engineering/ \n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting, a powerful technique in prompt engineering that encourages AI models to break down complex problems into step-by-step reasoning processes. We'll explore how to implement CoT prompting using OpenAI's GPT models and the LangChain library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "As AI language models become more advanced, there's an increasing need to guide them towards producing more transparent, logical, and verifiable outputs. CoT prompting addresses this need by encouraging models to show their work, much like how humans approach complex problem-solving tasks. This technique not only improves the accuracy of AI responses but also makes them more interpretable and trustworthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic CoT Prompting**: Introduction to the concept and simple implementation.\n",
    "2. **Advanced CoT Techniques**: Exploring more sophisticated CoT approaches.\n",
    "3. **Comparative Analysis**: Examining the differences between standard and CoT prompting.\n",
    "4. **Problem-Solving Applications**: Applying CoT to various complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Details\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial will guide learners through the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setting up the environment**: We'll start by importing necessary libraries and setting up the OpenAI API.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Basic CoT Implementation**: We'll create simple CoT prompts and compare their outputs to standard prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Advanced CoT Techniques**: We'll explore more complex CoT strategies, including multi-step reasoning and self-consistency checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Practical Applications**: We'll apply CoT prompting to various problem-solving scenarios, such as mathematical word problems and logical reasoning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, learners will have a solid understanding of Chain of Thought prompting and its applications. They will be equipped with practical skills to implement CoT techniques in various scenarios, improving the quality and interpretability of AI-generated responses. This knowledge will be valuable for anyone working with large language models, from developers and researchers to business analysts and decision-makers relying on AI-powered insights."

      "- **Charlie (Liar):** \"Amy and I are both liars.\"\n",
